            <h3>My Goals</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>My main goal in this program is to become confident in building complete projects from start to finish. </li>
               <li>I want to strengthen my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and learn to use frameworks like React effectively. </li>
               <li>I want to improve my problem-solving skills and write cleaner code</li>

               <li>Designing complex logic for larger websites</li>
               <li>React hooks and complex state management like useReducer</li>

            <h3>To my future self:</h3>
            <p>Progress does not always show up right away, but it builds quietly with every project, every fix, and every moment of persistence. </p>

         <section class="extra" data-testid="test-about-extra">
            <h3>Extra Thoughts</h3>
            <p>Front-end development is as much about creativity as it is about logic.
               <br>
             I have learned to enjoy the process of problem-solving and to see design from a more technical point of view. 
             <br>
             I hope to keep building projects that are not only functional but also expressive and user-friendly.</p>
